{"name":"Gghq.io","tagline":"GGHQ.io Website","body":"### Welcome to GGHQ.\r\nGGHQ is the definitive home for Gloucestershire Gaming. We regularly host online events and aim to host occasional LAN events in Gloucestershire. We aim to bring people together over a mutual love of video games. Our core values are that of passion, support, and inclusiveness, and our goals are to provide a community space for gamers to socialise online: A space where creators and community members can feel like they're valued and doing positive things.\r\n\r\n### Advocates\r\nWe’ve been lucky enough to garner support from some fantastic companies. Most notably, we have been made a [Humble Partner](https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription?partner=gghq) as well as a member of the [Discord Event Hypesquad Team](https://discord.gg/gghq). We also support and use products from [Kustom PCs](https://www.kustompcs.co.uk/), [LinuxGSM](https://linuxgsm.com/) and [Other].\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
